# NC News Seeding

Since .env.* files are ignored by Git, anyone who clones your project wonâ€™t have access to the required environment variables.

What you need to do:
set-up databases

1. in the root directory, create .env.test and .env.development
2. connect them to their respective databases:
    a. test: nc_news_test
    b. dev: nc_news

You should include:

A link to the hosted version.
A summary of what the project is.
Clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests.
Information about how to create the two .env files.
The minimum versions of Node.js, and Postgres needed to run the project.
