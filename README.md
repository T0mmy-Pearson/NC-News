# Northcoders News API

Hello! Welcome to Tommy's Northcoders News API. It's a RESTful API designed to show the backend functionality for a Reddit-style news application. It allows users to interact with articles, topics, comments, and users, offering a wide range of features such as retrieving articles, posting comments, and more.

You can access the hosted version of the API [here](https://northcoders-news-llke.onrender.com/api).
